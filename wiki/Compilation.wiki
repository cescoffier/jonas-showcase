= Preliminaries =

The build process is based on [http://maven.apache.org/ Maven]. So before building the application, you need to install and configure Maven.

= Getting the sources =

Once Maven is installed, download the sources, either from the [http://jonas-showcase.googlecode.com/files/jonas-showcase-1.0.0-src.zip download section] or by "checkouting" the code from svn with the following command:

{{{svn checkout http://jonas-showcase.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/}}}

= Compilation =

Once downloaded, execute the following command:

{{{mvn clean install}}}

This will build the modules composing the applications.
